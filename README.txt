Contents of this archive
------------------------
This archive contains several folders: 

(1) code: source code for computing the sample nonparanormal covariance matrices and solving the pDNA model.
 
(2) breast_cancer: a demo for testing our method using the ovarian cancer gene expression data. 
    Run "Demo_Ovarian_Cancer.m" in folder "breast_cancer" to test the algorithm.

(3) simulation: a demo for testing our method using the simulated data. Run "Demo_simulation.m" in 
    folder "simulation" to test the algorithm
